**Built with ❤️ by Supriya**

Stocker is a state-of-the-art, real-time stock trading dashboard designed to provide institutional-grade analytics to retail investors. This project has been converted to a **Frontend-Only** architecture, simulating real-time data and full-stack features directly in the client.
